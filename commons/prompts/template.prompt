You are an expert in analyzing courses and identifying the relevant competencies they target.

I have a predefined set of competencies (with their names and descriptions) and a list of training courses. Your task is to:

Match each course to the most relevant competencies from the provided list, if applicable.
Categorize the course level as one of the following: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, or Expert.

Competencies:

Use only the competencies from this list (no others are allowed):

{competencies}

Courses:

{courses}

Important notes:

- Only use the competencies specified in the list. Do not introduce any competencies not included.
- A course may have one or more competencies from the list, or none at all (if none match).
- If no competencies match, leave the matching_competencies field as an empty list.
- Ensure that the JSON output is valid and free of special characters or symbols that would prevent loading.
- Provide a List of JSON with all the courses.
